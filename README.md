> audio content collection for understanding buddhism

🔗 [source code](https://github.com/hoishing/buddhism-objc)

## Motivation

In 2010, I incidentally came across an audio content on the web by [Master Chin Kung (淨空法師)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chin_Kung) with the topic "Understanding Buddhism". I felt quite enlightened after listening that, so continued a dozen more audio lectures from him.

As those audio contents are free to share, I wrote an app to share the content in the Apple app store.

## Current Status

The app is now obsoleted and replaced by the websites below. So it can serve audiences from all platforms, not limited to iOS.

- [認識佛教 - 粵語版](https://hoishing.github.io/ruby-SSG/index_zh.htm)
- [認識佛教 - 華語版](https://hoishing.github.io/ruby-SSG/index_cn.htm)

The website is generated by the `plist` file from this iOS app using [ruby static site generator](https://github.com/hoishing/ruby-SSG).
