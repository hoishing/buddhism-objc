## Motivation

In 2010, I stumbled upon an audio clip on the web by [Master Chin Kung (淨空法師)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chin_Kung) with the topic "Understanding Buddhism". I felt quite enlightening with it, so continued a dozen more audio lectures from him about buddhism.

As I thought the audio contents might benefits those want to know more about buddhism, and they are free to share, I wrote this app to share those audio clips in the Apple [app store].

## Current Status

The app is now obsoleted and replaced by the websites below. So it can serve audiences from all platforms, not limited to iOS.

- [認識佛教 - 粵語版](https://hoishing.github.io/ruby-SSG/index_zh.htm)
- [認識佛教 - 華語版](https://hoishing.github.io/ruby-SSG/index_cn.htm)

The website is generated by the `.plist` files from this iOS app using an [ruby static site generator](https://github.com/hoishing/ruby-SSG) that I wrote.
