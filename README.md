> audio content collection for understanding buddhism

## Motivation

In 2010, I incidentally came across an audio content on the web by [Master Chin Kung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chin_Kung) with the topic "Understanding Buddhism". I felt quite enlightened after listening that, so continued a dozen more audio lectures from him.

As those audio contents are free to share, I wrote an app to share the content in the Apple app store.

## Current Status

The app is now obsoleted and replaced by a [website](https://b1.fbm.hk) instead. So it can serve audiences from all platforms, not limited to iOS.

The website is generated by the `plist` file from this iOS app using [ruby static site generator](https://github.com/hoishing/ruby-SSG)
